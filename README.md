# Stock Analysis

# Overview of Project

 Steve has parents that are interested in investing in the stock market. Like many people, his parents did not perform any research. They chose to invest based on name of stock and personal life experience related to the stock name. Steve is wanting to help his parents maximize their return on investment. Steve has asked us to refactor code we had initially created to drill down on actual stock return.
 
 The purpose of this challenge was for the students to become acclimated to VBA. For loops, nested for loops, if then statements, and variable creation allowed me plenty of exercise to gain a comfort level with utilizing Excel's VBA features.  A colorful end result demonstrated total daily volume and return of twelve different stock options. A timer was crafted into the VBA code to track the amount of time taken for the function to perform. With the help of the Snippit tool photos were taken of the timer results and entered under the resource folder in this repository. 
  
# Results

  The assignment began by creating a variable and output arrays. It was the perfect beginning to build needed confidence for creation of the remaining code.

  Step two utilized a for loop to set an array value as well as engineering a for loop that would evaluate the total data

  Challenges began during the crafting of the third step. Writer had difficulties with remembering to use appropriate indentations, end if codes, and placement of next i. This step consumed the majority of time necessary for completion of this assignment. If then statements were created to evaluate contents in beginning and end rows.

Finally, step four required coding to loop through the written arrays to retrieve appropriate data into the columns and rows.

Reviewing the available data from 2017 and 2018 show ENPH and RUN to have been the best selection. The gains of the two stocks in 2017 were not large, but they did not see a decrease into the red as the other stocks did. Steve's parents would have made a good choice if reviewing 2017 data alone. Unfortunately, 2018 saw a 62.6% loss in 2018.

# Summary

 Any individual who has written code before has an understanding of the time and attention required to write a code that will perform the specific function desired. One advantage of refactoring code is a decrease in the amount of time necessary to develop effective functions. Having stepped into this assignment with no prior VBA experience, I felt like a deer in the headlights. Thankfully notes written during class and resources posted in slack provided a starting point. Having these coding samples available afforded me the advantage of a stepping stone for refactoring. 
 
 How many times have you looked over a set of code instructions baffled by where the error lies? This is one disadvantage of refactoring code. Functions written in refactored code may not translate to the action you are attempting to obtain. Refactoring code can also lead to inadvertently leaving details out which are essential. 
 
 We all know the old adage, "If it's not broke, why fix it?". When writing code for a project it is very handy to refactor original VBA codes that perform the specific function sought after. Moving forward with VBA adventures I will most certainly refer to references and this challenge assignment for guidance in how to manipulate VBA by reviewing original codes for refactoring.
 
 One disadvantage of refactoring VBA code is potential plagiarism. What seems like a harmless copy and paste job could easily evict one from class or an employment position due to plagiarizing someone else's work. Another disadvantage of refactoring VBA code is a sizeable amount of time could be spent attempting to find the correct code for the desired action.
